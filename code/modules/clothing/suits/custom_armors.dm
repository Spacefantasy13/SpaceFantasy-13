/*
This file contains all modkit armor item paths. Why is this file used instead of light, medium, heavy or power armor files?
1. To avoid clutter - ALL custom items that are modkits are to be put here. No exemptions.
2. To avoid abuse of item-setting - ALL custom items that are modkits NEVER should have unique armor values.
3. ALL custom items that are modkits should ALWAYS pull from a master file. I.E - your custom armor a varient of T-45? Then pull from T-45. Do NOT make it a unique path.

Make sure you ALWAYS direct the icon path of these custom items to: "suit(s)_custom.dmi" - otherwise your sprite will not work! This is for organization simplicity.

Below you will find all the templates for modkit items.*/
